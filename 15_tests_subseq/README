For this assignment, you will be writing testcases for
your next assignment (as usual, the instructions for that assignment
can be found in next-README).

As usual, one correct and many broken implementations can be found
in /usr/local/l2p/subseq.

As with power, these are provided as compiled object files, and you
should write a C program (in test-subseq.c) whose main function tests
the maxSeq function. As before, it should exit with EXIT_SUCCESS if all
tests pass, and EXIT_FAILURE if any test fails.  Note that you will
need to write the prototype for maxSeq:

 size_t maxSeq(int * array, size_t n);

in your test-subseq.c file, so that the compiler knows about the
maxSeq function.  The correct place to put it is after you #include
any .h files you need, but before any other code you write.

We have provided run_all.sh to help you run your test cases against
all implementations.

HINT: Think about how can you can vary not just the values in your array
but the size as well. What about how the values change over time?
