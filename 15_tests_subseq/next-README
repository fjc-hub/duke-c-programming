 1. Create a file called maxSeq.c and write the function:
       size_t maxSeq(int * array, size_t n);

    which returns the length of the maximum increasing contiguous
    subsequence in the array.  The parameter n specifies the length
    of the array For example, if the array passed in were
   
     { 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 9}
  
    this function would return 4 because the longest sequence
    of (strictly) increasing numbers in that array is 1, 3, 5, 7
    which has length 4.  Note that 1,3,5,7,9 is an increasing
    subsequence, but is not contiguous (finding discontiguous 
    ones efficiently takes techniques we haven't learned yet).

    Note that the subseqence does not need to increase at a
    constant rate (or follow any other pattern besides being strictly
    increasing).  2, 4, 67, 93, 94, 102 would be a valid increasing
    sequence of length 6.


2. Compile and test your code using the test-subseq.c you wrote
   previously.  (as before, compile the .c files separately, and link
   them together).

3. Submit your code for maxSeq.c
     

Hint:
  Can you abstract a complex step out into a simple function?
