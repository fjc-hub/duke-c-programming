Decks (sets of cards)
---------------------

Note: if you have not completed the course 2 poker projects,
please use the fast-forward command to complete them first!

Now that you have learned about arrays, you are ready
to start working with decks and hands of cards (represented
as arrays of cards).  You will be using the card.c
file from your Course 2 project, as this project builds
on the same card_t type.  If you look in deck.h,
you will find the type declaration for a deck of cards:

struct deck_tag {
  card_t ** cards;
  size_t n_cards;
};
typedef struct deck_tag deck_t;

We'll use the same type for a deck of cards or a hand
of cards, since both are just a set of cards.

We'll note that we could have chosen to make an array
of cards (card_t * cards) but instead decided to make
an array of card pointers (card_t ** cards).  You may
wonder why we selected this design.   With this design,
when you shuffle an array, you will move the pointers
around, but they will point to card_ts that stay in the
same place.  This means that if you have OTHER pointers
(as you will have in Course 4 to handle unknown cards),
they will still point to the right place.

For example, if you have (Ah,Ks,Qc,?0):
         
        Ah    Ks    Qc    ?0<----to_replace
        ^     ^     ^     ^
        |     |     |     |	
        |     |     |     |
        |     |     |     |
     +--|--+--|--+--|--+--|--+
arr->|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+

and you shuffle the pointers in the array
(yielding, e.g, Ks, ?0, Ah, Qc) :

         /------\
        V        \
        Ah    Ks |   Qc    ?0<----to_replace
              ^  |   ^     ^
          ____/  \   \     /
         /     ___\___\___/
        /     /    \   ---  
     +--|--+--|--+--\--+--\--+
arr->|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+

the to_replace pointer still points at ?0
with no other changes.  If we had an array
of cards and shuffled them directly, it would
be much harder to do the card replacement later.


First, you will write four functions in deck.c:

 - void print_hand(deck_t * hand); 
   This should print out the contents of a hand.
   It should print each card (recall that
   you wrote print_card in Course 2), and
   a space after each card.  Do not put
   a newline after the hand, as this
   function gets called to print a hand
   in the middle of a line of output.
   

 - int deck_contains(deck_t * d, card_t c);
   This function should check if a deck
   contains a particular card or not.  If
   the deck does contain the card, this
   function should return 1.  Otherwise,
   it should return 0.
   (You will use this later to
   build the deck of remaining cards
   which are not in any player's hand).

 - void shuffle(deck_t * d);
   This function takes in a deck an shuffles
   it, randomly permuting the order of the cards.
   There are MANY valid ways to shuffle a deck
   of cards---we'll leave the specifics
   of the algorithm design up to you.  However,
   you will want to use random() to generate
   pseudo-random numbers.  (Pseudo-random
   numbers are quite sufficient here,
   since they are not used for security
   purposes). Note that you should not need to
   use the 'srand' function.

   We will note that in trying to devise
   this algorithm, you should not
   try to shuffle a deck of cards "normally".
   Instead, you should take a small number
   of cards, and think about ways
   to shuffle them that involve using
   random numbers to swap their order,
   or pick positions for them, or
   similar principles.

- void assert_full_deck(deck_t * d);
  This function should check that
  the passed in deck contains ever
  valid card exactly once.  If
  the deck has any problems, this function
  should fail an assert.  This will
  be used to help you test your deck
  shuffling: we will shuffle
  a full deck, then call assert_full_deck,
  so that you can identfiy problems with
  the deck.  You can print
  any error messages you want
  if there is a problem.
  Hint: you already wrote deck_contains.

------------
Once you have completed these functions, you should run

make test-deck

This will build the test-deck program which we
have provided which runs some test cases on your functions.
There is no one single right output, as you may shuffle
your deck any way that you want.  However, you should
read through the output and see if things make sense.
The first deck is built by using your card_from_num
function (from Course 2) for each value in the
range [0,52). Then the deck is shuffled
a couple times, with the results printed.
We call assert_full_deck on each of these.

Next we make a 5 card hand, and test
deck_contains on it, shuffle, and repeat
the process a few times.

The last thing we do is take the 5 card
hand and shuffle it 50,000,000 (50 Million)
times, counting how often each hand occurs.
In an ideal case, each of the 120 possible
5-card hands would appear equally often (0.833%
of the time).  If your shuffle is close
to this, then it is good.  If it is drastically
off, that is bad.

Since this can take a while, the test
program will print a '.' ever 500,000
shuffles to let you know it isn't stuck.

When it finishes, it will print out the
frequency (and ordering) of the most and least
common hands.  For my shuffling algorithm,
these were 0.836496% and  0.829262% respectively,
which is quite good.  If you end up with
things in the 0.823% (min) to 0.843% (max) range, that's
great.  If its in the 0.818%(min) to 0.848% (max) range,
that's good enough.  If you are outside of that, you
should try to work on your shuffling algorithm
to make sure you get good results from your poker
simulator.

We provide that hands that appear most and least
often in case it helps you debug.

Once you are satsified with the functionality
of your code for this part, run grade.
When you pass, you get the hand evaluation in
the next part.
