Poker: Almost There!
--------------------
Now it is time to wrap up your poker project!

You have four major things to do:
 (1) Write a few deck/evaluation functions that need
     malloc/realloc/free (which you were not ready for in
     Course 3).  
 (2) Write the code to handle unknown cards (which
     we'll call "future cards" because they will be
     known in the future).
 (3) Read the input.
 (4) Write a main function, which puts this all together
     and does the Monte Carlo simulation loop
     (repeatedly drawing different random cards
     for the future cards).

We're going to split this into 3 parts.  In this assignment,
you will do (1) above.  In the next assignment, you will do (2) and (3),
which will work together to process the input.  In the final assignment,
you will do (4), completing this project!


Finish deck/evaluation
----------------------
Add these functions to deck.c:
 - void add_card_to(deck_t * deck, card_t c);
   Add the particular card to the given deck (which will
   involve reallocing the array of cards in that deck).
 - card_t * add_empty_card(deck_t * deck);
   Add a card whose value and suit are both 0, and return a pointer
   to it in the deck.
   This will add an invalid card to use as a placeholder
   for an unknown card.
 - deck_t * make_deck_exclude(deck_t * excluded_cards);
   Create a deck that is full EXCEPT for all the cards
   that appear in excluded_cards.  For example,
   if excluded_cards has Kh and Qs, you would create
   a deck with 50 cards---all of them except Kh and Qs.
   You will need to use malloc to allocate this deck.
   (You will want this for the next function).
   Don't forget you wrote card_t card_from_num(unsigned c)
   in Course 2 and int deck_contains(deck_t * d, card_t c)
   in Course 3!  They might be useful here.
 - deck_t * build_remaining_deck(deck_t ** hands, size_t n_hands) ;
   This function takes an array of hands (remember
   that we use deck_t to represent a hand).  It then builds
   the deck of cards that remain after those cards have
   been removed from a full deck.  For example, if we have
   two hands:
      Kh Qs ?0 ?1 ?2 ?3 ?4
      As Ac ?0 ?1 ?2 ?3 ?4
   then this function should build a deck with 48
   cards (all but As Ac Kh Qs).  You can just build
   one deck with all the cards from all the hands
   (remember you just wrote add_card_to),
   and then pass it to make_deck_exclude.
 - void free_deck(deck_t * deck) ;
   Free the memory allocated to a deck of cards.
   For example, if you do
     deck_t * d = make_excluded_deck(something);
     free_deck(d);
   it should free all the memory allocated by make_excluded_deck.
   Once you have written it, add calls to free_deck anywhere you
   need to to avoid memory leaks.

Next, go back to eval.c, and implement:
 - unsigned * get_match_counts(deck_t * hand) ;
   You will find its prototype after the code you wrote
   in Course 3, and before the functions we
   provided for you.  Replace the prototype with
   your implementation.

   Given a hand (deck_t) of cards, this function
   allocates an array of unsigned ints with as
   many elements as there are cards in the hand.
   It then fills in this array with
   the "match counts" of the corresponding cards.
   That is, for each card in the original hand,
   the value in the match count array
   is how many times a card of the same
   value appears in the hand.  For example,
   given
     Ks Kh Qs Qh 0s 9d 9c 9h
   This function would return
     2  2  2  2  1  3  3  3
   because there are 2 kings, 2 queens,
   1 ten, and 3 nines.

We recommend you write your own testing code in a separate
C file (e.g., test-c4deck.c) and run your own test cases
before you submit.  When you are satisfied with the correctness
of your code, you should grade this assignment.

As a final note, we remind you that since previously released files
have been symlinked into other directories you may need to add the
original versions (as this is where your changes are reflected). For
example, in this assignment we have you modify deck.c which is symlinked
to ../c3prj1_deck/deck.c. This means when you submit the assignment you 
need to add and commit the actual file, not the symlink itself.
