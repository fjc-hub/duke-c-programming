 1. Open the file "squares.c" and look at the squares function.
    You will find that I have already done steps 1--4
    for an algorithm which draws two (possibly overlapping)
    squares (one of #s and one of *s). 

 2. Read the generalized steps that I have written as comments
    in this file.  Note that whenever I indicate a range
    (count from x to y, or between x and y), the range is 
    inclusive of the lower bound, and exclusive of the upper bound.
    All counting is "count up by one."  Determine if there are
    any parts of these steps that you will want to abstract
    out into a separate function.

 3. Implement this algorithm by translating my steps into code.
    You may abstract any pieces you want out into separate functions.
    We've provided two helpers with specification we think may be helpful.

 4. We have provided squares_test.o, which has a main function
    that takes four command line arguments (size1, x_offset, y_offset, size2),
    and calls your squares function with those arguments.
    You can compile your code and link it with this object file
    to make a program:
       gcc -o squares -Wall -Werror -std=gnu99 --pedantic squares.c squares_test.o
    Then you can run it like this:
      ./square 4 1  2 3
    which would call your squares function with
      size1=4
      x_offset=1
      y_offset=2
      size2=3

    which should produce output that looks like this:
####
#  #
#***
#*#*
 ***
We have also provided 3 files which show the correct output for three inputs
(./squares 3 5 8 2,./squares 5 2 4 6,./squares 9 2 3 4) in the files
whose names starts with ans_ (and then has the parameter values in its name,
separated by _s).

Use "diff" like you just learned to compare your program's output
to the correct output.

 5. Submit your modified squares.c file (git commit/git push/grade).
