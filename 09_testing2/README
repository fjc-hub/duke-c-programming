For this assignment, you will continue working on your blackbox testing
skills.  However, this time, you will test a slightly more complex program
with more broken implementations.

You can find the correct implementation of the program at

/usr/local/l2p/match5/correct-match5

This program determines who wins a very simple "card game".  This "game"
is played with 5 "cards" per player and 2 players.  A "card" in this
game is an ASCII character (so 'x' 'a' '!' '7' '$' etc are all valid cards).
Each player has exactly 5 cards, and the player with the most matching
cards wins.  That is, 5 of a kind beats 4 of a kind, which bests 3 of a kind,
which beats a pair, which beats having no matching cards.  If both
players have the same number of matching cards (e.g., both have 3 of a kind),
the hand is a tie.  There are no tie breakers (so one player has
3 of a kind and the other has 3 of a kind + a pair, the pair does not matter).
The values of the cards don't matter (so three 'a's and three 'b's both tie).

If you run the correct implementation, you can see the correct behavior:

As some examples:

$ /usr/local/l2p/match5/correct-match5 aaaaa bbbbb
Both hands tie: each has five of a kind

$ /usr/local/l2p/match5/correct-match5 aaaaa bbbbc
Hand 1's five of a kind beats Hand 2's four of a kind

$ /usr/local/l2p/match5/correct-match5 aaabb bbbbc
Hand 1's three of a kind loses to Hand 2's four of a kind

If you look in /usr/local/l2p/match5, you will see that there are 296 broken
implementations.   Note that you do NOT need to come up with 296 test cases---you
may have one test case which shows that several of these implementations
are broken.

Furthermore, to help make this testing managable for you, we have provided
run_all.sh, which will read test cases from  a file you create called tests.txt,
and run them against all broken implementations.  In particular, each line
of tests.txt should be the command line arguments to one invocation of the
program under test.  So if you wanted to test the program with the three
examples shown above, you would write the following in tests.txt

aaaaa bbbbb
aaaaa bbbbc
aaabb bbbbc

and then each broken program would be run three times, and have its behavior
compared to the correct implementation.  If ANY test case in tests.txt identifies
a problem with a particular broken implementation, your test suite has
succeeded for that particular implementation.  You need to develop
your test suite so that it identifies the problems with all broken implementations.


Lastly, I'll note that each of these broken implementations arises from
making small changes in the correct implementation which could represent
reasonable mistakes in programming (this is called "mutation testing" by
the way).  None of these require finding
an obscure "magic bullet" input---they can all be found with a reasonble,
comprehensive test suite.

You will submit tests.txt for this assignment.
