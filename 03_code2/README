Open the code2.c file you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  printTriangle and main.

As with the previous problem, the printTriangle function
has an algorithm written as comments, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which print out a triangle
with height 4, and the total number of stars in that triangle (returned
by the printTriangle function).

There is also a comment asking you to write a few more statements
to do the same thing for a triangle of height 7.
Add the code to do this.

When you have done this, run

./test.sh

As before, this script will try to compile your code (which you will learn about
ina n upcoming lesson), as well as run it.   If your code does not have legal
syntax, it will do its best to describe what is wrong.  If there
is a problem, look at the code and try to see where you did not follow
the syntax rules from Course 1  The line number and message it gives
may help you find the problem.  If you cannot find the problem after a minute
or two, ask for help.

If your code has legal syntax, test.sh will also run it, and show
you the output it produced, as well as the output we expected.

If they are the same, you should commit, push, and grade.

If they are not, you should see if you can fix the problem (and ask for help
if you cannot).
